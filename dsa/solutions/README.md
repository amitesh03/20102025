## Conventions

- File naming: {problem_id}_{kebab_case_title}.cpp
- Code style: C++ STL, clear variable names, minimal macros.
- Header comment at top of each file includes:
  - Problem title and LeetCode link
  - Brief question summary and constraints
  - Approach and complexity
- Some problems are cross-referenced between folders according to their primary technique.

## Notes

- Build artifacts (if any) are placed under build/.
- Some editors may show false IntelliSense errors for standard library calls; the solutions are written to standard C++ and compile on typical online judges and local compilers.
