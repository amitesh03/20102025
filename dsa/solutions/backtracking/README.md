# Backtracking â€” Practice Overview

Scope:
- Concepts: recursive search, pruning, permutations/combinations, constraint satisfaction
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Notes

- The above problems are implemented and present in this folder.
- Backtracking templates: consider using recursion with early pruning (e.g., duplicate handling) and parameterized state (path, index, used flags).
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
