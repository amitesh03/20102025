Scope:
- Concepts: ordered traversal, invariants, LCA
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Notes

- All above problems are implemented and present in this folder.
- Cross-reference LCA and BST traversal patterns with Trees and LCA/Binary Lifting sections for broader context.
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
