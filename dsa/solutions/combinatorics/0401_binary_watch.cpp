/*
LeetCode 401. Binary Watch
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/

Question:
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11) and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59).
Given an integer turnedOn representing the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:
- 0 <= turnedOn <= 10

Approach (Enumerate and count bits):
- Enumerate all hours h in [0..11] and minutes m in [0..59].
- If popcount(h) + popcount(m) == turnedOn, format the time as "h:mm" (minutes zero-padded to 2 digits).
- Use Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm for popcount to avoid compiler-specific intrinsics.

Complexity:
- Time: O(12 * 60) = O(1) constant
- Space: O(1) extra (excluding output)
