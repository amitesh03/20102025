# Combinatorics â€” Practice Overview

Scope:
- Concepts: combinations, subsets, counting constructions, generation with constraints
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Related and Cross-Referenced

- 78. Subsets
  - Implemented in Backtracking: [solutions/backtracking/0078_subsets.cpp](../backtracking/0078_subsets.cpp)

## Notes

- Subsets problems (78, 90) are grouped under Backtracking due to recursion and duplicate-handling patterns; they are conceptually combinatorics.
- Some problems may overlap with Bit Manipulation (e.g., bitmask enumeration).
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
