# DP â€” Practice Overview

Scope:
- Concepts: dynamic programming patterns (1D/2D, memoization, tabulation, transitions)
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Notes

- All above problems are implemented and present in this folder.
- For DP templates and patterns, see transitions (max/min, count) and memoization strategy across provided solutions.
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
