/*
LeetCode 200. Number of Islands
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Question:
Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

Constraints:
- m == grid.size, n == grid[i].size
- 1 <= m,n <= 300
- grid[i][j] âˆˆ {'0','1'}

Approach (BFS flood fill):
- Iterate cells; when a '1' is found, increment count and BFS to mark the entire island as visited by turning to '0'.
- Use a queue and 4-directional neighbors within bounds.

Complexity:
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(min(m*n)) for queue in worst case island size
