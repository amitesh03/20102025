LeetCode 695. Max Area of Island
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/

Question:
Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the maximum area of an island in the grid.
An island is a group of 1s connected 4-directionally (up/down/left/right). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Constraints:
- m == grid.size, n == grid[0].size
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1}

Approach (Iterative DFS with stack):
- Iterate over all cells. When a cell with value 1 is found, start a DFS (using an explicit stack)
  to explore the whole island.
- During traversal, mark visited cells by setting them to 0 to avoid revisits.
- Track the size of the current island and update a global maximum.
- This avoids recursion depth issues and uses only STL containers.

Complexity:
- Time: O(m*n), each cell visited at most once
- Space: O(m*n) in worst case for the stack
