LeetCode 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/

Question:
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path from top-left to
bottom-right. A clear path has only 0s, and moves can be in 8 directions (including diagonals).
If no such path exists, return -1.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 100
- grid[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1}

Approach (Layered BFS with 8 directions):
- If grid[0][0] or grid[n-1][n-1] is blocked (1), return -1 immediately.
- Perform BFS from (0,0) exploring 8-directional neighbors that are within bounds and equal to 0.
- Use a visited matrix to avoid revisiting cells.
- Count levels to determine path length.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n^2)
