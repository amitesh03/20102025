## Notes

- Greedy interval selection typically sorts by end time to maximize non-overlapping choices (e.g., 452).
- When resources are constrained by overlaps (e.g., 253), use min-heaps or difference arrays to track concurrent intervals.
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
