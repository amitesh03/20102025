## Notes

- Some problems appear under their primary conceptual topic directory (e.g., Group Anagrams under Strings, Prefix Sum under Arrays). They are cross-linked here to show coverage for Hash Map/Set concepts.
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
