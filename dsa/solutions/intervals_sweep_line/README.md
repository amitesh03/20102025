# Intervals & Sweep Line â€” Practice Overview

Scope:
- Concepts: interval merging, overlap detection, sweep line with events, two-pointer interval processing
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Problems and Status

- [x] 986. Interval List Intersections
  - LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/

## Notes

- Some interval-related problems are organized in other focused folders based on their primary technique:
  - Greedy end-time scheduling, non-overlapping intervals, and arrow shots in [solutions/greedy_intervals/README.md](../greedy_intervals/README.md)
  - Skyline and calendar allocation variants using segment tree in [solutions/segment_tree/README.md](../segment_tree/README.md)
  - General array-based interval merges in [solutions/arrays/README.md](../arrays/README.md)
- For any missing problems or corrections, update this README and add the corresponding solution file with the problem statement header.
