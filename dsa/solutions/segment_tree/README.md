# Segment Tree â€” Practice Overview

Scope:
- Concepts: segment tree (point/range updates, queries), coordinate compression, lazy propagation
- Language: C++ STL
- Each solution file includes the problem statement at the top in comments and uses idiomatic STL.

## Notes

- For Fenwick Tree/BIT problems, see [solutions/segment_tree_fenwick/README.md](../segment_tree_fenwick/README.md)
- Many solutions use coordinate compression to keep tree size compact.
- When constraints allow, alternative approaches may be included in problem headers.
