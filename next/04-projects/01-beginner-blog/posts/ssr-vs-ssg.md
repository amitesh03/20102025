# SSR vs SSG: When to Use Each

When building a Next.js application, one of the key decisions you'll need to make is whether to use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for your pages. Both approaches have their strengths and are suited for different use cases.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### What is SSR?

Server-Side Rendering generates the HTML on the server for each request. This means that every time a user visits a page, the server fetches the necessary data and renders the page HTML before sending it to the client.

### When to use SSR:

1. **Frequently changing content**: If your page content changes often and needs to be up-to-date on every request.
2. **User-specific content**: Pages that display personalized content based on user authentication or preferences.
3. **Real-time data**: Pages that show live data like stock prices, weather information, or live scores.
4. **E-commerce product pages**: When product information, pricing, or inventory changes frequently.

### Example use cases:

- Social media feeds
- User dashboards
- Search results pages
- News websites with breaking news

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

### What is SSG?

Static Site Generation generates the HTML at build time. The pages are pre-built as static HTML files that can be served directly from a CDN.

### When to use SSG:

1. **Marketing pages**: Landing pages, about pages, and documentation.
2. **Blog posts**: Content that doesn't change frequently.
3. **Portfolio sites**: Showcase projects that don't update often.
4. **E-commerce product listings**: When product information doesn't change frequently.
5. **Help documentation**: Static content that provides information.

### Example use cases:

- Personal blogs
- Corporate websites
- Documentation sites
- Portfolios

## Performance Considerations

### SSG Performance Benefits:

- **Faster load times**: Pre-built HTML files can be served instantly from a CDN.
- **Better SEO**: Search engines can crawl the content more easily.
- **Lower server costs**: No need to render pages on each request.
- **Higher reliability**: No database or API failures to worry about.

### SSR Performance Benefits:

- **Always up-to-date**: Content is fresh on every request.
- **Personalization**: Can serve user-specific content.
- **Dynamic content**: Can handle real-time data effectively.

## Hybrid Approach

Next.js allows you to use a hybrid approach where some pages use SSG and others use SSR. This gives you the flexibility to choose the best rendering strategy for each page based on its specific requirements.

```javascript
// SSG page
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  return { props: { posts } }
}

// SSR page
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const user = await getUser(context.req)
  return { props: { user } }
}
```

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Next.js also offers Incremental Static Regeneration, which allows you to update static pages after build time. This gives you the benefits of SSG with the ability to update content without rebuilding the entire site.

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  return {
    props: { posts },
    revalidate: 60 // Revalidate at most once every 60 seconds
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Choose SSG for content that doesn't change frequently and benefits from fast load times and SEO. Choose SSR for content that needs to be up-to-date on every request or requires personalization. Consider using a hybrid approach to get the best of both worlds.
