- **Basic Transactions**: SOL transfers and transaction structure

###  📁 Level 2: Token Operations
- **SPL Token Basics**: Creating mints, ATAs, and transfers
- **Token Extensions**: Advanced token features

###  📁 Level 3: Program Development
- **Native Programs**: Writing Solana programs in Rust
- **Anchor Framework**: Using Anchor for easier development

###  📁 Level 4: Advanced Topics
- **AI Integration**: Solana Agent Kit
- **Game Development**: Building blockchain games
- **dApp Development**: Full-stack applications

## Detailed Learning Modules

### Module 1: Cryptography & Key Management
```
fundamentals/
├── keypair-generation.js     # Creating wallets
├── connection-setup.js      # Network connections
└── basic-transaction.js   # Transaction basics
```

### Module 2: Core Concepts
```
- Account model explanation
- Transaction lifecycle
- Fee structure
- Network architecture
```

### Module 3: Development Tools
```
- Solana CLI setup and usage
- Anchor framework installation
- Testing and deployment workflows
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)
- Install Node.js and npm/yarn
- Set up development environment
```

### 2. First Steps
```javascript
// Generate your first wallet
import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
const wallet = Keypair.generate();
console.log('Public Key:', wallet.publicKey.toBase58());
```

### 3. Development Workflow
1. **Local Development**: Test with local validator
2. **Devnet Testing**: Deploy to public test network
3. **Mainnet Deployment**: Launch to production
```
