- Atom families
- Provider and scope
- useAtom hook

### 2. Advanced Patterns
- Async atoms
- AtomWithStorage for persistence
- Atom effects
- Computed atoms
- Conditional atoms

### 3. Integration
- TypeScript support
- DevTools integration
- Testing with Jotai
- Server-side rendering
- Next.js integration

### 4. Best Practices
- Atom organization
- Performance optimization
- Memory management
- Debugging techniques

## Examples
