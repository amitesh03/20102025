# Recoil State Management

Recoil is an experimental state management library for React apps. It provides several capabilities that are difficult to achieve with React alone, while being compatible with the newest features of React.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Recoil Fundamentals
- Atoms (units of state)
- Selectors (derived state)
- useRecoilState hook
- useRecoilValue hook
- useSetRecoilState hook

### 2. Advanced Recoil
- Atom families
- Selector families
- Async selectors
- Atom effects
- Persistence with recoil-persist

### 3. Integration
- TypeScript support
- DevTools integration
- Testing with Recoil
- Server-side rendering
- Next.js integration

### 4. Performance
- Component optimization
- Selective re-rendering
- Memory management
- Debugging techniques

## Examples
- Basic counter with atoms
- Todo list application
- Form state management
- API data fetching with selectors
- Local storage persistence
- Complex derived state with selectors
