- States and transitions
- Events and actions
- Context and extended state
- Guards and conditions
- Hierarchical states

### 2. Advanced XState
- Parallel states
- History states
- Invoked services
- Machine communication
- Statecharts visualization

### 3. Integration
- TypeScript support
- React integration (@xstate/react)
- DevTools integration
- Testing with XState
- Server-side rendering

### 4. Best Practices
- Machine design patterns
- State organization
- Performance optimization
- Debugging techniques

## Examples
- Basic toggle machine
- Todo list with state machine
- Form validation machine
- API data fetching
- Multi-step wizard
- Complex authentication flow
