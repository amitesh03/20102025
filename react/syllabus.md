### React Hook Form
- Form handling and validation
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Form validation schemas
- Dynamic form fields
- Integration with UI libraries

## Styling Solutions

### Styled Components / Emotion
- CSS-in-JS styling approaches
- Component-scoped styles
- Theme providers and theming
- Dynamic styling with props
- Performance optimizations

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework
- Responsive design
- Custom components and variants
- Dark mode implementation
- Integration with React

## Animation

### Framer Motion
