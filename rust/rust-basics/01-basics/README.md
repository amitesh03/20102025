# 01. Rust Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Rust programming language.

## Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Mutability**
2. **Data Types**
   - Scalar types (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
   - Compound types (tuples, arrays)
3. **Functions**
4. **Comments**
5. **Control Flow** (basic introduction)

## Key Concepts

### Variables and Mutability

In Rust, variables are immutable by default. You can make them mutable using the `mut` keyword.

### Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, which means it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

### Functions

Functions are the building blocks of Rust programs. They're defined using the `fn` keyword.

## Examples

Each example in the `examples/` folder demonstrates a specific concept. Run them with:

```bash
cargo run --bin example_name
```
