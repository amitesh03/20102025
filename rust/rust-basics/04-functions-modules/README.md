   - Function parameters and return values
   - Closures
   - Higher-order functions
2. **Modules**
   - Creating modules
   - Controlling visibility
   - Using modules
3. **Crates**
   - What is a crate
   - Using external crates
4. **Paths**
   - Absolute paths
   - Relative paths

## Key Concepts

### Functions

Functions are the building blocks of Rust programs. They can be defined anywhere and can capture variables from their enclosing environment.

### Modules

Modules help organize code within a crate. They control the visibility of items and allow you to group related functionality together.

### Crates

A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. It can be a binary or a library.

## Examples

Each example in the `examples/` folder demonstrates a specific concept. Run them with:

```bash
cargo run --bin example_name
```
