# 05. Structs and Enums

This section covers structs and enums, which are fundamental for creating custom data types in Rust.

## Topics Covered

1. **Structs**
   - Defining and instantiating structs
   - Tuple structs
   - Unit-like structs
   - Methods and associated functions
2. **Enums**
   - Defining enums
   - Enums with data
   - Option enum
3. **Pattern Matching**
   - Matching on structs
   - Matching on enums

## Key Concepts

### Structs

Structs are similar to tuples in that they hold related values together, but unlike tuples, you name each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean.

### Enums

Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. They can contain data in their variants.

## Examples

Each example in the `examples/` folder demonstrates a specific concept. Run them with:

```bash
cargo run --bin example_name
```
