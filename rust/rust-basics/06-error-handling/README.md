# 06. Error Handling

This section covers Rust's approach to error handling, which emphasizes robustness through explicit handling of errors.

## Topics Covered

1. **Panic!**
   - When to use panic!
   - Unrecoverable errors
2. **Result Type**
   - Handling recoverable errors
   - Propagating errors
3. **Option Type**
   - Handling the absence of a value
4. **Error Handling Best Practices**

## Key Concepts

### Panic!

Panic! is for unrecoverable errors that should stop the program.

### Result

Result is an enum that represents either success (Ok) or failure (Err).

### Option

Option is an enum that represents either some value (Some) or no value (None).

## Examples

Each example in the `examples/` folder demonstrates a specific concept. Run them with:

```bash
cargo run --bin example_name
```
