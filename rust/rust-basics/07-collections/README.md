# 07. Collections

This section covers Rust's collection types that store multiple values in a single data structure.

## Topics Covered

1. **Vectors**
   - Creating vectors
   - Updating vectors
   - Reading elements
2. **Strings**
   - Creating strings
   - Updating strings
   - Slicing strings
3. **Hash Maps**
   - Creating hash maps
   - Accessing values
   - Updating hash maps

## Key Concepts

### Vectors

Vectors allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.

### Strings

Strings are collections of characters. Rust has two string types: String and &str.

### Hash Maps

Hash maps store a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V using a hashing function.

## Examples

Each example in the `examples/` folder demonstrates a specific concept. Run them with:

```bash
cargo run --bin example_name
```
