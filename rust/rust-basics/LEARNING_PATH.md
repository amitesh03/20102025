## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

### Prerequisites
- Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code with Rust extension recommended)

### Working with Examples
Each module contains:
- `README.md` - Detailed explanations of concepts
- `examples/` - Practical code examples
- `exercises/` - Practice problems with solutions

To run an example:
```bash
cd module-folder
cargo run --bin example_name
```

To solve an exercise:
1. Try to fix the issues in the exercise file
2. Check your solution against the provided solution
3. Run with `cargo run --bin exercise_name` or `cargo run --bin solution`

### Learning Tips
1. **Type along** - Don't just read the code, type it yourself
2. **Experiment** - Modify the examples and see what happens
3. **Solve exercises** - They reinforce the concepts
4. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn to small projects
5. **Read the docs** - Get comfortable with Rust's official documentation
