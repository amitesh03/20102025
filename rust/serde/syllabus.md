# Serde Serialization Framework Syllabus

## Course Overview
This course covers Serde, a powerful serialization and deserialization framework for Rust. Serde provides a unified approach to converting Rust data structures to and from various data formats like JSON, YAML, TOML, and many others. Students will learn to effectively use Serde for data serialization in their Rust applications.
