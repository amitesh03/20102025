# SQLx Database Library Syllabus

## Course Overview
This course covers SQLx, a modern SQL toolkit for Rust. SQLx provides compile-time checked queries without a DSL, async support, and a pure Rust implementation. Students will learn to build database-backed applications using SQLx's powerful features and type-safe query interface.
