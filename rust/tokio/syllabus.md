# Tokio Async Runtime Syllabus

## Course Overview
This course covers Tokio, Rust's most popular asynchronous runtime for building reliable, asynchronous, and slim applications. Tokio provides the necessary components for writing asynchronous network applications, including a multi-threaded runtime, async I/O, timers, and more. Students will learn to build high-performance concurrent applications using Tokio's powerful features.
