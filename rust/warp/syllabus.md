# Warp Web Framework Syllabus

## Course Overview
This course covers the Warp web framework, a super-easy, composable web server framework for warp-speed development with Rust. Warp is built on top of Hyper and provides a functional approach to web development with powerful filters and composability. Students will learn to build efficient web applications using Warp's elegant filter-based API.
